This project was very likely manageable for me. My base of html and css is getting fixed quite well, and the sign-up form was really nice to practice. Additionally, it was also a good practice for `chaining selectors` and `hover` property. This project consists only of the frontend form and not storing the inserted values for backend handling.

However, I encountered this difficulty: the `opacity/transparency` for the `left-container` was a tricky one, using the `RGBA` worked well for what i needed (to be able to see the Odin logo and title well and clear - while the children, before, were inheriting opacity and was messing up the style);
